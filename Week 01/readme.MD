# **Homework - Week 01**

## Phase 1 specs

This first phase involves creating a working prototype of a program which can read in data about a 10x10 icon with a bit depth of 1 (on/off, black/white) and display it to the user via a simple character-based output. Students with interest can implement functions to manipulate the icons.

### purpose

Create a program in python that uses looping and basic data structures to display customized 10x10 student icons in various scales and orientations.

### program requirement 1: basic display

Create a data structure (list, tuple, dictionary) that can represent the sequence of on and off cells in each icon inside your python program

### program requirement 2: display

Read your custom data structure to display a visual representation of your icon using a single symbol, such as an asterisk or an at-sign.

### program requirement 3: manipulation

Implement one or more transformations on a given icon, starting with scaling, such that each "cell" is represented by not just one character, but a square of characters of a given size. Consider other transformations such as inverting on and off cells, or rotating by a specified amount of degrees

### program requirement 4: functionalization

Review your code and break it up into as many sensible functions as possible, allowing for code re-use. Comment each function such that its purpose is clear to other users.

### program requirement 5: sharing

Post your code on your github account and then email Eric ~~redacted~~@ccac.edu with the URL to your repository. Also, choose an icon from  [material.io](https://material.io/icons)  and send Eric the name of your chosen icon to accompany your link on technologyrediscovery.net
