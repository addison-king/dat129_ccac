### Mini Task 1
Use a for loop to list all project info in a neatly formed set, like shown in the screen shot below:

### Mini Task 2
Write a method called logMalformedProject that is called each time a project is visited by the main loop that does not contain a value for the key 'area'. This method should write the project id to a single line in a log file with an appropriate name.

### Mini Task 3
Create a method that assembles a list of unique values for the project area. If you are feeling ambitious, do the same for 'status' and 'asset type' since this will come in handy during the search specification.
