# **Homework - Week 02**

## Overview
*1.  Clone down a peer's git repository from last week. Create a new branch from their primary work branch on which you can make adjustments without interfering with their workflow.
2.  Implement functionality to **allow for display of an icon written to a text fil**e. The program should ask the user for the name of the file (assuming it's in script's directory) AND the character used to represent no shading and the character used to represent shading.*

## Git-Book
Read & bookmark the git book: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Phase 2: Peer analysis (continuation from Week 01, phase 1)

With your specs from phase 1 complete, you should now have a working program to share with your peers on github. With your instructor, choose a peer's project to review and carry out the following analytic steps:

1.  Read your peer's code carefully and create a functional flow diagram either on paper or on a mini white board. Include the function name and a brief phrase discussing its purpose in the tool chain.
2.  Populate the table below this numbered list with metrics relating to your peer's code as you proceed through these steps, starting with basic counts of number of lines and number of functions along with the average length per function
3.  **Adjustment A**: The raw data for each icon from CIT-115 students happens to be encoded in a series of 100 characters such that a 'P' means there is coloring present in a given cell, and an 'N' means there is no coloring present. What do you believe would be the minimum changes required to undetake this change?
4.  **Adjustment B**: In a strange turn of events, a printer that Eric works with has agreed to print the icons onto T-shirts but they must be rectangular and not square to maximize the use of the screen printer. The code must now adjust the aspect ratio of the inputted icons by "chopping" off the left and right columns, leaving the matrix 8 cells wide by 10 cells tall.
5. **Adjustment C**: Implement functionality to **allow for display of an icon written to a text fil**e. The program should ask the user for the name of the file (assuming it's in script's directory) AND the character used to represent no shading and the character used to represent shading.*
