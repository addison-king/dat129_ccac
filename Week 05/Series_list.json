Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelion's one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with the Evangelion. One such teenager is Shinji Ikari, whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelion. Thrust into a maelstrom of battle and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything.",

         "overview": "The Mary Whitehouse Experience was a UK topical comedy show, both on radio and TV, in the late '80s/early '90s. Its main stars were David Baddiel, Rob Newman, Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis.\r\n\r\nIt started in 1989 as a radio show, devised by Bill Dare, on BBC Radio 1. The two pairings of Newman and Baddiel and Punt and Dennis were central to the show - they would later have spin-off television series of their own. Guest performers included Nick Hancock, Jo Brand, Jack Dee, and Mark Thomas.\r\n\r\nIt had four radio series, building up an audience and moving to better time slots. After the fourth series, it was decided to move the show to television. The television run started in 1990 on BBC 2. It lasted two series, a total of 13 episodes including its pilot. A spin-off book of the show was also published.\r\n\r\nThe series was a mix of surreal sketches and monologues, in a format similar to shows such as Mr. Show and The Kids in the Hall. (The Kids in the Hall also had a sketch about a character who suffered from a disease that made him sound sarcastic much like this show's character 'Ray', although this appears to be coincidental)\r\n\r\nThe show was named after Mary Whitehouse, a prominent campaigner against what she saw as a decline in television standards and public morality. She became famous in the UK going after shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus and Doctor Who. She threatened legal action against the show for its name.\r\n\r\nThe television series has never been released nor repeated by the BBC. Episodes of the radio series have been repeated on BBC 7. An online petition has been set up to lobby the BBC to release the television series on DVD.\r\n\r\nA book The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia, which was a spin-off of the series containing references to some of the sketches on the show and much new material, was released in 1991.",

Variety of material brought with it a variety of tone, from the deadly serious to the tongue-in-cheek, stretching the television anthology concept to its very limits.",

In one episode, Eliot even enters Dog City himself to join Ace in solving a mystery.\r\nA recurring gag was that many of the characters in the cartoon were seemingly based on the residents of Eliot's apartment building. The bulldog crime-boss Bugsy Vile was inspired by the building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno. Ace's love interest Rosie was based on Eliot's unrequited feelings for his neighbor Colleen, and so on. The Muppet characters were unaware of this.",

In the country, resentment is growing, and resistance movements, every bit as brutal as the oppressors, make their presence felt.\r\nUnrepeated since broadcast back in '71 (and never screened in NI), this is quite an offbeat, and IMO often uneven series, that pulls few punches and eschews easy moral positions.

From his flat in Notting Hill Gate, Ray Purbbs edits an 'underground' (that is, counterculture) magazine, Mouth, assisted by his fellow hippies Alex, Jill and Hugo. Ray is passionate about protest, ludicrously enthusiastic about every hip trend and convinced he is (or could be) a major player in the battle between the Establishment and the alternative society. Alex - though he comes from a wealthy background and seems more interested in golf than altering society - is coolness personified, a man so laid-back he seems to exist outside of reality. Jill embraces all the new-found liberty afforded her gender and claims to espouse free love, though this attitude doesn't stretch to her 'boyfriend', Ray, long been deprived of her carnal interest. Hugo is spectacularly vague, almost brilliant in his obliqueness. Led by Ray, the quartet jump on every trendy bandwagon and comprehensively fail to make the slightest bit of difference in all they do. The gang are pretty useless at everything - in fact, they're not even that good at being hippies.",

         "overview": "The half-hour show takes place in Ottawa, Ontario, and revolves around the everyday happenings of the Spencer family, more frequently Kevin himself. His parents are Anastasia and Percy Spencer. Anastasia (voiced by Thomasin Langlands) is a fat, drunken, and promiscuous woman, a curious cross, it would seem, between a hoser (a stereotypical Canadian) and a hick. Curiously, she often ends up having sex, despite being immensely unattractive in just about all senses of the word. Often she receives sex because of people wishing to get back at her husband, Percy. Percy (voiced by Lawrence) is also a fat, drunken, loud, boorish and illiterate oaf, so stupid it is questionable whether he can write his own name. With parents like these, it is not the least bit surprising that Kevin is a \"chain-smoking, alcoholic, sociopathic\" juvenile delinquent at the age of 14.\r\nMost of the adventures on the show revolve along illegal schemes committed by any or all three of the characters. Most of the time their motive is nothing more than the ability to acquire more money than their welfare cheques give them. Kevin occasionally goes to school, encountering other stereotypes and people who are almost as stupid as his parents.\r\nKevin's character is slightly more interesting in the fact that he is obviously in possession of some degree of intellect. The show never uses his voice (until recently), but suggests that he tells people rather detailed and articulate things or asks intelligent, legitimate questions when faced with an argument. Instead, the show's narrator (voiced by Lawrence) speaks for him. More often than not these arguments are dismissed by the person that hears them, and this usually causes Kevin to respond to what his environment led him to be the answer: violence.\r\nAnother frequent character in the show is Allen the Magic Goose, an anthropomorphic chain-smoking goose that is the other inspiration behind many of Kevin's misadventures, but is just a figment of his imagination.",

Heading up the Really Serious Crimes Squad is the microwave meal loving, part time cinema attendant Chief (Peter Bland). Other colleagues include department git Gary Bateman (Jeremy Gittins), Dingwall's desk based love interest of Beverley Armitage (Race Davies) and two incredibly boring plain clothes detectives (Simon Godley and Neil Mullarkey).",

Ralph Bates was Michel Lebrun, the Deputy Director, who was concerned about keeping to the rules. Fiona Gaunt played Doctor Helen Smith, the base's psychiatrist, and Barry Lowe played Tom Hill, the head of the base technical section.\r\nThe programme was notable for its combination of realistic spaceflight procedures.\r\nAlthough very dated in terms of its looks and assumptions about the future, it remains well-regarded in retrospect.\r\n\r\n",

Unlike the film, its sequels, and the 1974 live-action television series, which involved a primitive ape civilization, Return to the Planet of the Apes depicted a technologically advanced society, complete with automobiles, film, and television; as such it more closely resembled both Boulle's original novel and early concepts for the first Apes movie which were changed due to budgetary limitations in the late 1960s.",

Cavalry Command was in essence a military organization, maintaining an army and fleet of ships to protect the New Frontier. Within Cavalry Command was a unit of special operatives known as Star Sheriffs that functioned as field agents, investigating crimes and plots against the security of the New Frontier.\r\n\r\nThe main foe of Cavalry Command and the Star Sheriffs was a race of non-human creatures known as Vapor Beings (or Outriders) that jumped into our dimension in order to conquer it. They attacked the settlers, destroyed settlements and kidnapped humans in order to mine various metals or crystals from the soil.\r\n\r\nOutriders were superior to humans in battle technology, possessing a legion of gigantic robots with uncanny firepower against which the space-going fleets of Cavalry Command were no match. In order to have a chance against such supremacy, Cavalry Command developed a prototype ship known as the \"Ramrod Equalizer Unit\" (or just Ramrod) that had the ability to turn from spaceship into a powerful robot that could fight the Outriders on equal terms.",

This set contains both series.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental protesters, a shoplifting epidemic, a burgeoning butter mountain and largely incompetent staff are just a few of the problems facing Cecil Slinger, the new manager of Supafare. And just how is he supposed to offload 560 packets of Jacobson's Savoury Fishcakes when no-one wants to buy them? Slinger has to concede that the public doesn't respond to lying, cheating and deception any more. Whatever happened to the old values?",

As in the film, the three women have concocted a scheme to land a rich husband by placing themselves in same social scene as rich bachelors. The three rent a pricey penthouse apartment together at the Tower House on Park Avenue and vow to help each other land a rich husband. While their address may be ritzy, Greta, Mike and Loco struggle to make the rent, are constantly faced with the threat of eviction and barely make ends meet.\r\n\r\n",

A smart enough chap, witty and bright; but women do often cause him to blush. This, however, is never an obstacle to his romantic intentions. What always is the obstacle is his mother - domineering, overbearing and omnipresent. Timothy still lives at home with his parents and it's his smothering, bossy mother who insists on treating him as if he were still a little boy.\r\n\r\nHis father often joins Timothy in silent defiance of this Gestapo officer in a dress, and his sister Muriel--who left the nest, like a Colditz escape party, many moons ago--is often there to lend an ear and offer advice. Timothy would love to fly away, but the apron strings seem to be made of reinforced steel. Will he ever cut them? Will his romantic dreams ever come true? Or will his mother always sabotage his relationships, and he remain forever SORRY? ",

Unlike the simple-minded man depicted in the movies, this cartoon had an intelligent, well-spoken Tarzan who was accompanied by a monkey sidekick, N'kima. In many ways, this series was the most faithful of all screen-based adaptations of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, and featured a number of \"lost cities\" from the original novels. The rotoscoped animation is based upon the work of Burrough's favorite Tarzan artist, Burne Hogarth.",

         "overview": "There are few actors so closely tied to a persona than Raymond Burr as Perry Mason. This long-running series was built upon Erle Stanley Gardner\u00b4s many novels about a brilliant defense lawyer and his staff, that solved many a crime with surprise witnesses and stern cross-examinations.It was the first mystery series to feature chalk or tape outlines to mark the spots where bodies were found. Filmed almost exclusively in the Los Angeles area, Raymond Burr had Gardner's seal of approval in the role. The cases were usually won by way of pivotal confessions of witnesses, solicited by Perry Mason (Burr's) surgeon-like examination or with last-minute, key evidence brought into the courtroom by private investigator, Paul Drake (William Hopper). Della Street (Barbara Hale), Perry\u00b4s faithful secretary, was always at Perry's side in the courtroom where hapless Hamilton Burger (William Tallman) was the Los Angeles District Attorney who never seemed to win. As to the myth that Perry Mason never lost, there were 2 episodes where it did occur... but you'll have to watch to find out.The show was revived in 1973-74, with other actors in the familiar roles (Monte Markham as Mason), and then again with the some of the original cast, in a string of feature length TV films from 1985 until Raymond Burr\u00b4s death in 1993.",

The label around his neck reads simply: \"Please look after this bear. Thank You.\" When the Brown family takes him in, they get a lot more than they bargained for.\r\n\r\nPaddington is a stranger in a strange land and much of the charm of his adventures comes from his unique way of looking at the world. Many things others take for granted are exactly what he finds so fascinating and worthy of investigation.\r\n\r\nPaddington Bear has a knack for turning everyday life into an all-out adventure. Helpful and curious, Paddington always puts his paws where he shouldn't and inevitably finds himself in sticky situations. He doesn't go looking for adventure, it just seems to find him!\r\n\r\nBut that's part of his charm: Who else could take first prize at the dance contest without knowing the first thing about dancing? Who else could win the Tour de France \u2014 on a tricycle? And who else could inadvertently become a guest speaker at the White House?\r\n\r\nWhy Paddington, of course!",

Now Jobeth Williams is playing the part of Reggie. Her adversary in the movie, Roy Foltrig is also there. Only their relationship is not as adversarial as it was in the movie.

In 1974, Tony Orlando & Dawn's already huge recording career morphed into a hit weekly CBS-TV variety show, the result of a very successful 4-week summer replacement run. Originating as The Tony Orlando & Dawn Show and ending as The Tony Orlando & Dawn Rainbow Hour, the show received strong ratings and further endeared Tony Orlando, Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent in the hearts of America.",

Tiswas was far too good for kids on a saturday morning, a lot of it was beyond us. I always remember my dad used to sit with me and my sisters laughing more than we were. In the early eighties they tried to do an adult version called O.T.T, it was awful. Why make an adult version when the kids' version had the adults laughing more than the kids. I occasionally see kids t.v on a saturday morning, how much happier they'd be if they had the phantom flan flinger and Algernon Razzmatazz. ",

They reveal their keen appreciation of Shakespeare by enacting Brutus and Cassius' quarrel in Julius Caesar and, in a nod to contemporary theatrical trends, Cleopatra's death scene is played in modern dress. To clear up any possible confusion, there\u2019s even a sketch to help viewers remember which one is which...\r\n\r\nThe series was billed on-screen as Two Of A Kind until 1963 and The Morecambe and Wise Show from 1964 onwards. However, for its entire run it was referred to by its stars and in TV listings as The Morecambe and Wise Show.",

They go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line \u2013 mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and, specifically, waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father'.\r\n\r\nAlways an involving and clever novel, the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the railway-man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train).\r\n\r\n'The Railway Children' is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. As we watch Bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture. Throughout we have a sense of time and place \u2013 be it from the steam trains, the university paper chase, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).",

Patrick Bauchau and Andrea Parker co-starred as Sydney, Jarod's childhood teacher and mentor, and Miss Parker, a childhood friend. They are both operatives for a mysterious organization called \"The Centre\", which took Jarod from his parents as a child and developed his special talents with the intention of making him one of their agents, while also using his brilliant intellect for their own evil purposes. After escaping from their custody, Jarod begins traveling the country, searching for clues to his true identity while posing as a doctor, police officer, attorney, or some other character who helps those in trouble. The Centre's directors are determined to return Jarod to The Centre to further their mysterious plan. A team of operatives, led by Miss Parker, attempts to find and capture The Pretender. Jarod's extreme intelligence combined with his childlike innocence create a memorable and endearing character that was popular with viewers.",

What made 'RSG' special was that it arrived at the same time as the British beat boom, when groups such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who were on the verge of taking the music world by storm, a time when 60's youth culture hit the streets running and swept aside all that stood in its way, a time that was fresh and exciting. The show finished in 1966 at the height of its popularity and has since gone on to attain cult status. ",

From the writer and executive producer of \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Kiss of the Dragon\" and the executive producers of Smallville, The WB's \"Black Sash\" features a multigenerational cast, dazzling martial arts and stories of hope and redemption.\r\nAs an undercover narcotics cop, Tom Chang (Wong) paid a high price for staying true to his values. Framed and wrongly incarcerated in Hong Kong for allegedly smuggling heroin, he loses his career, his wife and the right to see his daughter. All he has left are the blazing skills of a master martial arts combatant. Now, after five years in a Hong Kong prison, Tom has come home to San Francisco, intent on restoring his life.\r\nOnce back in San Francisco, Tom's mentor, Master Li (Mako, Pearl Harbor), gives Tom his martial arts school to run and a place to live in his building on the wharf. Tom finds a new family in the young men and women he trains in Chinese martial arts. His dedicated students include Tory Stratton (Missy Peregrym, Dark Angel, The Chris Isaak Show), a fiercely beautiful 17-year-old who has turned to martial arts as a way of dealing with the rage she feels over the death of her policeman father. A newcomer to the group, Trip Brady (Corey Sevier, Little Men ) is the victim of a violent father. For Trip, Tom's knowledge and kindness open the door to a new life. Bryan Lanier (Ray J, Moesha) is a tough-talking, streetwise teenager with a quick wit and a deep loyalty to his fellow students and to Tom. Another newcomer is the shy and warm-hearted Allie Bennett (Sarah Carter, Undeclared), who is searching for acceptance, friendship and for some of the skill and bravery she admires in Tory.\r\nTom relies on the spiritual guidance of Master Li to help him deal with issues that arise in his life and the lives of his students",

         "overview": "Rock Profile is a British television comedy show written by and starring comedy partnership Matt Lucas and David Walliams, both later widely known for the sketch show Little Britain. Rock Profile first appeared on the channel UK Play in 1999, before moving to BBC Two in 2000. The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving Jamie Theakston questioning Lucas and Walliams, who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or just downright fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.",

The show follows the bachelor as he goes on a series of dates with the women, some of them group dates, some one-on-one dates. On each episode women are eliminated, generally during the rose ceremony at the end of the episode, but sometimes on the dates (during what are called \"elimination dates\"). The process culminates towards the end of the season with a few of the women going on overnight dates, and meetings between the bachelor, the women, and their respective families. At the end of the show, the bachelor chooses one woman with whom he would like to continue a relationship. Sometimes he proposes marriage, sometimes other levels of commitment.\r\n\r\nThe runner-up from the first season, Trista Rehn, later starred in The Bachelorette, a spin-off program in which the format is gender-reversed.",

So, the wind up was Bobby Heenan getting his own talk show, which can best be described as a cross between Larry Sanders and Fernwood 2 Night with a little bit of Howard Stern's first TV show thrown in. The Bobby Heenan Show was well ahead of its time, and I believe only a few episodes were run before it went off the air. Like Police Squad and Get A Life, it was an incredibly funny show that had a cult following, but a cult following doesn't keep you on the airwaves.",

After the commercial break, the outcomes of the various choices were shown before Dirk acts on the correct idea (with the occasional exception) to save the day.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the original game, the previously nameless Dragon was known given the name Singe, and Princess Daphne now wore a long pink dress.",

The format was essentially the same as vaudeville, and although vaudeville had died a generation earlier, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.  Seasons 1-8 can be found listed under the series \"Toast of the Town\".",

         "overview": "Harvard-trained Latino attorney John Alvarez defies all expectations with his witty and nonconformist attitude. The comedy series depicts his character struggling to fit in the upscale corporate culture as well as his parents' blue-collar world. Although he works for a prestigious Manhattan law firm, John remains loyal to his traditional Queens, New York upbringing, and he never lets his success get in the way of his family and childhood friends. Living and working together with his beautiful attorney girlfriend Nancy Slaton has its advantages, but it's a romance kept secret from the firm which has strictures against dating co-workers. Nancy is a fun-loving, intelligent perfectionist with a good heart. Since she is very much in love with John and quite the opposite of him, her conservative Upper East Side upbringing balances her relationship with her no-rules boyfriend. John has always been more of a leader than a follower, as his father, Luis Alvarez, would tell you. As a working class barber who owns a barber shop in Queens, Luis is very proud of his lawyer son. He is John's biggest fan, but his old-world ways sometimes put him at odds with his unconventional son. Despite John's nonconformist nature, his more conventional colleagues know he can get the job done. Ruthlessly ambitious attorney Henry Beckett will go to any length to advance in the firm. Not too scrupulous about how he gets ahead, he can be somewhat sarcastic and constantly finds himself challenged by office manager Maria Marquez. Famous for her long and wild nails, Maria is witty and flamboyant, and she efficiently does her job. The nervous and somewhat hapless Peter Gutenhimmel is an uptight associate whose father is a partner in the firm, and he never seems to truly live down his nepotistic origin.",

Coupling gives us insight on modern romance and its often humorous consequences. \r\n\r\n\"When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. \r\n\r\n\"Susan is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, Chicago's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. \r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Steve, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff  is Steve's \"porn buddy\" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling.\" ",

         "overview": "Super Friends returned to ABC on Saturday September 8, 1984 with a new thirty minute program that typically featured two 11-minute stories per episode. This incarnation featured Superman, Batman, Robin and Wonder Woman, and also the Wonder Twins and Gleek, this time teamed up with Firestorm. In addition to this core group, episodes during this season also featured some cameos by old and new Super Friends. The program lasted one season until August 31, 1985. The appeal of this version of the series at the time were the emphasis on actual villains from the comic books. Brainiac, Lex Luthor, Mirror Master, Mr Mxyzptlk, as well as Darkseid and his henchmen from Apokolips, all made appearances. Mirror Master only used pocket mirrors and larger mirrors to capture the Super Friends. He didn't use any ray guns or mirror traveling. Darkseid and his underlings were actually introduced into animated form in this series. One of the oddities of the show's opening credits is the depiction of Brainiac as he appeared in the 1970s and early 1980s even though on the episodes of this series, Brainiac's appearance was in line with the comic book's of that time period \u2014 being depicted in a more skeletal form. Another oddity was having Aquaman appear in the opening sequence but he never made an appearance throughout this run of the series.\r\n\r\nThis season, and the one to follow, featured the \u201cSuper Powers\u201d tag which was part of a marketing tie-in with a toyline of the same name produced by Kenner",

By using basic colors and the original sound effects, effort was put forth to capture the look and feel of classic Disney.\r\n\r\nEach half-hour episode consisted of a variety of cartoons, varying in length from ninety seconds to twelve minutes. These shorts fell into three general types: the brief gag cartoons, the longer character-based cartoons, and the more classically-based \"Mouse Tales\" (usually the show's longest segment). The character-based segments also included \"Silly Symphonies\", carrying on the tradition of that series of theatrical shorts.",

These bizarre creatures are Sam and Max, the Freelance Police. Getting their orders in the form of brief, cryptic phone calls from the Commissioner, a man who they have never met but is the duo's only contact with any real government agency, Sam and Max battle evil villains everywhere from the moon to the past to their back yard. They are assisted by The Geek, a teenage genius who lives in Sam and Max's Sub-Basement of Solitude. Throughout all of their battles and quests, Sam and Max's own style of humor, although zany and weird, allows them to make it in what they do.",

Wuzzles features a variety of short, rounded animal characters (each called a Wuzzle, which means to mix up). Each is a roughly even, and colorful, mix of two different animal species (as the theme song mentions, \"...livin' with a split personality\"), and all the characters sport wings on their backs, although only Bumblelion and Butterbear are seemingly capable of flight. All of the Wuzzles live on the Isle of Wuz. Double species are not limited to the Wuzzles themselves. From the appleberries they eat to the telephonograph in the home, or a luxury home called a castlescraper, nearly everything on Wuz is mixed together in the same way the Wuzzles are. The characters in the show were marketed extensively.",

As an influential member of the Conservative party, the Earl secures a seat in Parliament for Richard, with the expectation that he will support conservative policies. He tries his best to please his wife's family but, being a Liberal at heart, Richard finds it's not always that easy. These political and financial differences are a reoccurring source of contention for the Bellamys.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the lives of the family living upstairs couldn't seem more different than those of the servants living below but, strangely enough, through the years their lives often intersect, becoming increasingly entwined as time goes by.\r\n\r\nThe addition of real-life events, like the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic and the horrors of World War I, incorporated into the storylines add a touch of authenticity and realism to the show.",

         "overview": "Out of the Unknown is a British television science fiction anthology drama series, produced by the BBC and broadcast on BBC2 in four series between 1965 and 1971. Each episode was a dramatisation of a science fiction short story. Some were written directly for the series, but most were adaptations of already published stories.\r\n\r\nThe first three years were exclusively science fiction, but that genre was abandoned in the final year in favour of horror/fantasy stories. A number of episodes were wiped during the early 1970s, as was standard procedure at the time. A large number of episodes are still missing but some do turn up from time to time; for instance, Level Seven from series two, originally broadcast on 27 October 1966 was returned to the BBC from the archives of a European broadcaster in January 2006.",

The series showcased the short sci-fi films of both unknown and known filmmakers, giving rise to the channel's own Exposure Studios. Hosted by actress Lisa Marie, the films presented a wide range of science fiction subject matter. The series received poor ratings and was canceled in the fall of 2002. The series was originally shown on Sundays at 10:00pm EST and was repeated the following Saturday at 2:00am EST, later on the time was changed to 11:00pm EST and still repeated the following Saturday well after Midnight, which probably is a major reason for the poor ratings this show received. The series also had two guest hosts. Terry Farrell would host the \"Best of Season One\" episode and director Kevin Smith hosted the \"Star Wars Short Films Showcase\".\r\n\r\nThe Sci-Fi Channel had also struck a deal with AtomFilms which gave them the broadcast rights of any of Atom Films' new science-fiction acquisitions, as well as all science fiction films currently in their library, for Exposure.\r\n",

         "overview": "WCW Saturday Night was a weekly Saturday night TV show on TBS produced by World Championship Wrestling. The program existed through various incarnations under different names before becoming WCW Saturday Night in 1992. Although initially the anchor show of the Ted Turner-backed wrestling company, the September 1995 premiere of WCW Monday Nitro airing on sister station Turner Network Television usurped the show's once preeminent position in the company, as the primary source of storyline development and Pay-Per-View buildup. The show's place in the company was further devalued by the advent of WCW Thunder in 1998, airing on TBS and providing the secondary wrestling and storyline development that WCW Saturday Night had produced in the wake of Nitro's burgeoning three-hour long format. Once the cornerstone of the WCW wrestling empire, WCW Saturday Night ended its run in 2000 as the company struggled creatively to meet the demands of producing over six hours of new broadcast material on a weekly basis. The rights to WCW Saturday Night now belong to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as a result of that company's 2001 takeover of WCW.",

         "overview": "James Kirkridge (Stevenson) was a middle-aged insurance salesman who was experiencing a gradual reversal in finances, so much that he and his wife Kiki (Brooke Alderson) had to put up their rambling, palatial house in the suburbs up for sale, and downsize. Jesus \"Jessie\" Rodriguez (Avalos), a native of the Los Angeles barrio, had recently become successful as the owner of a landscaping business, enabling him and his wife Maria (Yvonne Wilder) to trade up to a more upscale neighborhood. Both couples ended up purchasing condominium units right outside a quaint Los Angeles-area fairway, and became each other's next-door neighbors. The white-bread Kirkridges at first mistook the Rodriguezes as the groundskeepers, but when Jessie informed them that he and his clan were in fact owners of the condo next door, wariness and bigotry ensued, mainly between staunch traditionalist James, a WASP, and the hot-headed, Roman Catholic Jessie, who had no patience for out-of-touch whites. Kiki, slightly daffy but strong enough to keep James from stepping out of line, was a little more accepting of her Hispanic neighbors, but found culture shock causing occasional friction between her and feisty Maria especially.",

For every issue he champions, there is the underlying knowledge of human frailty and a wry acknowledgment that his own personal and professional past is riddled with missteps. As a former undercover narcotics cop, he understands the realities of the street and the compromises cops sometimes make. He also knows the limitations that surround those who cut, collect, and expose the last secrets of a life lived, and the insights they can offer into death.\r\n\r\nDa Vinci's Inquest is a Canadian dramatic television series that aired on CBC Television from 1998 to 2005. Seven seasons of thirteen episodes each were filmed for a total of ninety-one episodes. The show, set and filmed in Vancouver, stars Nicholas Campbell as Dominic Da Vinci.",

Relying on the words of Greek and Roman historians, Wood sought to follow Alexander's route of world conquest as closely as possible, and it is simply amazing how much folklore about the great general he is able to pick up on the way. Beginning in Greece and proceeding through 16 countries, including Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan, and India, Wood listens intently to local storytellers who are still passing down the legends of Alexander. In one fascinating segment, Wood is barred from entering Iraq, but he is able to view the terrain on which Alexander's troops faced the Persians by scanning the radar screens of an American AWACS plane patrolling high above. In the course of his travels, Wood passes through four war zones and he notes that strategic regions of Alexander's day are still \"on the fault lines of history.\" This is a lengthy production, clocking in at almost four hours, but the relaxed pace is a virtue, as Woods and the people he meets along the way, from local storytellers to noted historians, pass along an amazing array of historical knowledge. Lovers of history will find this documentary to be a joy and may well find themselves savoring every mile of Alexander's great journey.",

In the mid-1980s through early 1990s, WWE fans would scour the television listings each month - making sure they didn't miss the highly anticipated special that replaced network staple Saturday Night Live on occasion. When Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller and Dana Carvey weren't performing comedy sketches, WWE Superstars were squaring off in matches that often took on a pay-per-view feel. The show's original theme song was \"Obsession\" by the band Animotion, but by the time the first run of the series ended in 1992, the music was changed to a generic theme.",

         "overview": "Jim Ellison was a U.S. Army Ranger who spent 18 months in the Peruvian jungle after his unit was killed. During this time, he developed hyperactive senses that came online five years later, when he was a detective in Cascade PD's Major Crimes Department. When he goes to the hospital to see a doctor, he finds instead Blair Sandburg, an anthropologist from Rainier University who tells him that he's a Sentinel. In ancient tribes, Sentinels protected the village. For Jim, Cascade is his village. Blair has been studying Sentinel mythology for years, but he never found before a person with all five senses enhanced, a true Sentinel.\r\n\r\nBlair helps Jim control his senses and joins Jim as a police observer. To the surprise of many people, this unlikely partnership works and together they fight against crime in the streets of Cascade.\r\n\r\nJim's hyperactive senses mean he can see beyond what others see, even in the dark, and with more detail; hear sounds that are farther than normal range or too low for anybody else; sense what nobody else can with taste, touch and smell, in short becoming a walking forensic lab. But Jim's powers have a drawback: if he concentrates too strongly in one sense, he could \"zone out\", a kind of catatonic state. Part of Blair's job is preventing the zone outs.\r\n\r\nThe only person who knows Jim's secret, apart from Blair, is his captain and friend, Simon Banks, and in the last half season, so does Megan Connor.",

Fist of Fun began as a BBC Radio 1 series in 1993, before becoming commissioned as a television series on BBC Two in early 1995.\r\n\r\nIt was broadcast at 9pm on Thursday nights, and was successful, but not a major ratings-winner. The second series was aired on Friday nights, and although its ratings were relatively good, the show suffered from a lack of preparation and poor promotion. The show was not given a third series, and Lee and Herring went on to write This Morning With Richard Not Judy, for BBC Two.",

         "overview": "Mad Jack the Pirate is a short lived 1990s cartoon. The show was created by Bill Kopp and was directed by Jeff DeGrandis (who previously worked together on Toonsylvania). On American television, the show was broadcast on Fox Kids.\r\n\r\nThe concept is of the adventures of the rather unsuccessful and cowardly Pirate Jack (voiced by Bill Kopp) who despite his failures never doubts his own excellence and his dim-witted anthropomorphic rat sidekick Snuk (voiced by Billy West) as they sail the seas on their ship the Sea Chicken.\r\n\r\nOften noticed by fans and viewers of the show is its similarity to the BBC comedy series Blackadder. Similarities of the main characters: Jack to Edmund Blackadder and Snuk to Baldrick and even almost identical quotes from the series. Even Jack's archenemy Flash is not unlike Lord Flashheart and Angus is similar to McAngus. Currently, in some countries, the cartoon has DVD & VCD Editions. Also in Turkey, the cartoon was shown on Jetix Play and in Poland on Fox Kids.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 2001, Mad Jack and other properties of Saban Entertainment were sold to The Walt Disney Company.",

It gave a big break to future household names like Kate O\u2019Mara,  Liza Goddard,  Gabrielle Drake and Colin Baker.\r\n\r\nThe gritty BBC serial, created by Gerard Glaister and writer NJ Crisp,  caught the attention of the viewing public to such a large degree that Colin Baker\u2019s loathsome city banker Paul Merroney was voted the \u2018Most Hated Man In Britain\u2019 by readers of The Sun newspaper.

         "overview": "The Adventures of Spin and Marty premiered on The Mickey Mouse Club in 1955 and scored an instant hit. Like many of Disney's most successful creations, Spin and Marty  was a simple story. Rich, coddled Martin Markham (David Stollery) arrives at the Triple R in his grandmother's limousine and dismisses the dude ranch for boys as \"a dirty old farm.\" His comment angers everyone, especially Spin Evans (Tim Considine), the most popular boy on the ranch. Over the course of the summer, Marty learns to relax and make friends; he and Spin become best buddies. Humor and wisdom are dispensed by wrangler Ollie (Leonard P. Greer), \"Well I'll be a blue-nosed gopher!\"; Marty's fussy butler, Perkins (J. Pat O'Malley); avuncular foreman Bill Burnett (Harry Carey, Jr.); and George (Sammee Tong), the Chinese cook, who regales the boys with Western songs in Cantonese. The characters proved so popular Disney brought them back in The Further Adventures of Spin and Marty (1957) and The New Adventures of Spin and Marty (1957).\r\n\r\nFor Baby Boomers, Spin and Marty packs the kind of nostalgic wallop the \"Andy Hardy\" movies and The Wizard of Oz had for earlier generations. During the '50s, millions of kids dreamed of spending the summer at the Triple R. In More Tales of the City, Armistead Maupin suggests that whether you identify with Spin or Marty constitutes a key division in American society, comparable to who your favorite Beatle was. In the extras, a dismayingly old Considine and Stollery revisit the ranch in Newhall, CA, where the series was filmed. This set is a sure-fire gift choice for aging Boomers. (Unrated, suitable for all ages: minor violence) \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yipp-i, yipp-a, yippi-o!\" THE ADVENTURES OF SPIN AND MARTY was an overwhelmingly popular series within THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB. Featured here is the entire first season (1955) about freckle-faced Spin and wealthy city kid Marty at the Triple R Ranch summer camp. Adding to the fun are exclusive interviews with the original cast members",

         "overview": "Who Dares Wins was a British television comedy sketch show broadcast between 1983 and 1988, featuring Jimmy Mulville, Rory McGrath, Philip Pope, Julia Hills and Tony Robinson. It was one of the first TV outlets for alternative comedy and was broadcast by Channel 4 late at night in a first attempt at \"Post-Pub television\" (the opening title sequence shows a man staggering home from the pub to get to the television in time for the programme).\r\n\r\nIt was eventually aired by the Playboy Channel in cable television outlets in the United States.\r\n \r\nThe show's title is also the motto of the British Special Air Service regiment (see Who Dares Wins), whose badge featured in the title sequence, and was often supplemented by a subtitle, e.g., \"a week in Benidorm\".\r\n\r\n\r\nMulville, McGrath and Pope had all contributed material to Not the Nine O'Clock News. Other script material was provided by Not the Nine O'Clock News regulars Colin Bostock-Smith and Andy Hamilton as well as alternative comedy writer Tony Sarchet. The series established Mulville's Hat Trick Productions as a producer of comedy material for Channel 4.\r\n\r\nThe show was recorded at the former independent production facility Limehouse Studios, on a soundstage in front of a live audience.\r\n \r\nThe programme sometimes satirised current events but the mainstay was simple observational comedy and frequently employed base humour (for example, the tracking camera shot in the title sequence showed a drunk who had urinated in his trousers).",

New to Perfection is tour guide Tyler Reed and Rosalita Sanchez, a mysterious woman with a past. Government representative W.D. Twitchell keeps an eye on the whole situation.",

'Spot the Old Woman' a regular skit wherby viewers were challenged to spot the old lady planted in the audeince of another show or piece of news footage, Newsnight, Kilroy, Question Time etc.. There was the puppet of Tony Blair that travelled the country. Then there was them digging up the Blue Peter time capsule and replacing the contents with porn, or draping the BBC headquarters with a 'Vote Conservative' banner. The schedules eventually forced the show to Friday night, and the Friday Night Amistice, with the Saturday night repeat being Last Friday Night's Amistice. There were a couple of specials, two Christmas and an Election 1997 show where they had a accopello choir singing the tunes of famous news shows over the years. Strange but never dull the show was last aired in 1999 for a New Year Special. ",

Characters from several of the more popular games were featured in \"Saturday Supercade,\" a weekly cartoon series perhaps most notable for being Donkey Kong's first starring appearance in a cartoon series. The famous gorilla starred in his own segment, this time as a well-meaning but slow-witted (and sometimes easily manipulated) gorilla who had escaped the circus; his trainer, Mario, and then-girlfriend Pauline (of whom Donkey Kong had a huge crush), tried to capture the large ape. Other segments included \"Donkey Kong Jr.,\" the famous gorilla's young son who was aided in his search by his human friend, Bones; \"Frogger,\" about an investigative amphibious reporter for the Swamp Gazette; \"Pitfall,\" featuring the adventures of Pitfall Harry, his pet mountain lion Quickclaw and his niece Rhonda as they traveled through the forest in search of treasure; and \"Q*Bert,\" about the misadventures of a teen-aged orange creature. The latter two segments were shown on alternate weeks during the first season. During the show's second season, only \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Q*Bert\" returned. Two new segments included \"Kangaroo,\" about a young mother kangaroo and her son, Joey, who were constantly harassed by a quartet of mischievous monkeys; and \"Space Ace,\" a teen-ager who fought aliens plotting to invade Earth",

The show featured a different subject each week presented by a celebrity connected with subject. In May 2002 is was announced that Top Ten TV and its parent series would be axed in favour of new programming despite the second series gaining over 2 million viewers (approximately 13 per cent of the available audience). This came in the wake of the ITC (Independent Television Commission) criticising the amount of 'list programmes' being broadcast.",

Nunez, Jr. star as the infantrymen who represent diverse racial, cultural and philosophical backgrounds but must ultimately depend on one another to get through the war alive.",

For those who had a questionable life but whom he deems deserves a second chance, the judge sends them back to a pivotal point in the past where their life path was determined. However they are sent back as someone other than themselves but with the full knowledge of their mission of their own redemption. In addition, they only have three days to change that life path. The judge also provides them with a guide, who is also recently deceased but is deemed by God to have a mission of assistance before his final fate is determined. Although always visible to the person he is assisting, the guide has the ability to be seen or not be seen by those around him, his invisibility when he wears the clothes in which he died. ",

         "overview": "Drexell's Class starred Dabney Coleman in the role of Otis Drexell, a fifth-grade teacher at fictional Grantwood Elementary School in Cedar Bluffs, Iowa. In the backstory, it was revealed Drexell was a famous corporate raider who lost a large amount of money on a failed venture, to which he dodged his taxes and was subsequently arrested. At his court case, he was told that he would get a suspended sentence on the basis he work as a teacher in the undermanned school until he pays his back taxes. Drexell is also a divorced man whose two daughters live with him. Besides the bevy of cute kids, the cast also included two antagonists, rival teacher Roscoe Davis (Dakin Matthews) and Principal Francine Itkin (Randy Graff), who was later succeeded by Principal Marylin Ridge.",

In that tradition, \"Music Scene\" featured such guests as Crosby Stills and Nash, Janis Joplin, James Brown, Judy Collins, and The Rascals as well as The Beatles' in the form of their 1969 video, \"The Ballad Of John And Yoko\" . Early Rock, Adult Contemporary , R n B and Country were also featured with the appearances of Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers,Tony Bennett, Eydie Gorme , Lou Rawls, Jerry Butler, Sonny James and others",

The show was notable for its frequent use of clips from old movies and TV shows to express Martin's inner life and feelings, which lent it much of its quirky appeal, reminding viewers about the impact of TV on their consciousness. The show was also significant for being one of the first American sitcoms to use uncensored profanity and nudity.",

A team of government scientists known as the \"Combined Miniature Defense Force\" had been voluntarily shrunk to microscopic size in order to gain access to areas too small for normal-sized explorers. Commander Jonathan Kidd led the crew, which traveled aboard a high-tech vehicle called the Voyager. With scientist Busby Birdwell (who built the ship) at the controls, the Voyager could dive underwater like a sub, fly through the air like a plane, or rocket off into space like a UFO.\r\n\r\nThe cartoon version also featured Professor Carter, biologist Erica Lane, and the mystical Guru, who possessed some kind of \"mysterious power.\" Whatever it was, it came in handy\u2014in every episode, the crew faced unknown microscopic creatures, as well as shrunken enemy spies, all out to stop the CMDF.\r\n\r\nWhile the animation was simple and the story lines even simpler, Fantastic Voyage won points for its ability to stay true to the original movie. Each episode paid close attention to the detail of the miniature world, which was, without a doubt, the main hook of the show. The producers also refused to patronize their audience with simplistic dialogue, giving the show a more grown-up feeling.",

Peter Church (Peter Phelps) is the most experienced officer in the unit, but not one who easily takes direction. Constables Angie PIper (Kate Kendall) and Oscar Stone (Ian Stenlake) round out the team. Jess Napier played Kaye Kelso, a newcomer who dropped out after the the first five episodes. After the second season, Rocca left the unit and McKenzie was promoted to DSS. Soon after Dannie Mayo (Roxane Wilson) joined.\r\n \r\nBig changes followed the death of Oscar Stone and the departure of Ellen McKenzie at the end of Series 5. The undercover unit became Special Investigations and moved from its 'front' garage back to police HQ. Insp. Luke Harris (Gary Sweet) took command, providing a wavering hand as he struggled to hide his bipolar disorder from his superiors. Chris Dichera (Jacinta Stapleton) and later Leo Flynn (Daniel Frederickson) joined Church and Piper as the undercover team for the later series of the show which had 8 series and 192 episodes in all.",

He's also probably the nearest thing Roger has to a friend.\r\n\r\nKevin is married to the lovely Maggie (Josie Lawrence), a very outgoing, affectionate woman. She adores Kevin and has a seemingly insatiable appetite for sex (as long as it's with Kevin).\r\n\r\nThis programme was based on Richard Harris's stage play, which had previously been televised in 1982 (with Paul Eddington as Roger, Prunella Scales as Miriam, Jonathan Lynn as Kevin and Maureen Lipman as Maggie).\r\n\t",

The other is Frances, a sardonic and sarcastic ex-headmistress who has divorced a pig named Michael who took the house when they seperated.

'Reba' began with the Hart family in the midst of a divorce as Texas soccer mom Reba watched her white-picket-fenced world collapse before her very eyes. Her dentist husband, Brock(Christopher Rich), left her after what she thought was 20 happy years of marriage for his impossibly perky and unfortunately pregnant dental hygienist, Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman). The cherry on top of this bitter sundae was the pregnancy of Reba's then 17-year-old daughter Cheyenne (JoAnna Garcia) and her decision to marry her high school football star boyfriend, Van (Steve Howey). Rounding out the happy brood is teenage Kyra(Scarlett Pomers), who continues to greet puberty with venom, and son Jake (Mitch Holleman).",

The series began on the launch night of Channel 4 on 2 November 1982, and ran for 21 years until 4 November 2003. The series was produced by Mersey Television and it was conceived by Phil Redmond.\r\n\r\nBrookside became very successful for a number of years and is notable for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines. It was at its most popular in the 1980s and the early 1990s. From the mid-1990s it began raising more controversial subjects under the guidance of new producers such as Mal Young and Paul Marquess. \r\n\r\nIt is especially well-known for broadcasting the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television, as well as a powerful domestic abuse storyline resulting in murder. The series caused an uproar when it featured a storyline featuring a consensual incestuous sexual relationship between two sibling characters during 1996. Brookside was also the first British soap to feature an openly gay character when (Gordon Collins) came out in 1985, and it was also the first to depict serious drug addiction with a number of different characters. \r\n\r\nAlthough the series had a long and successful run, by 2000 its viewing figures were in terminal decline and low ratings eventually led to its cancellation in July 2003.  The final episode was broadcast on 4 November 2003 and was watched by around 2 million viewers.",

         "overview": "Leave It to Beaver is a 1950s and 1960s family-oriented American television situation comedy about an inquisitive but often naive boy named Theodore \"Beaver\" Cleaver and his adventures at home, in school, and around his suburban neighborhood. The show has attained an iconic status in the United States, with the Cleavers exemplifying the idealized suburban family of the mid-twentieth century.\r\nOne of the first primetime sitcom series filmed from a child's point-of-view, the show was created by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, two radio and early television writers, who found inspiration for the show's characters, plots, and dialogue in the lives, experiences, and conversations of their own children. Like several television dramas and sitcoms of the late fifties and early sixties (Lassie and My Three Sons, for example), Leave It to Beaver is a glimpse at middle-class, American boyhood. A typical episode features Beaver getting into some sort of trouble and facing his parents for reprimand and correction.",

However, the SRA forces played their trump card and dropped hundreds of space colonies onto the Earth, plunging the planet into a seven-year-long nuclear winter. The UNE collapsed, but the SRA was unable to invade the Earth in the aftermath of the colony drop. Fifteen years have passed. The year is now After War 0015, and a New UNE has sprung up on Earth to restore order. In space, the colonial leaders have been rebuilding their own forces as well. By chance, fifteen-year-old Garrod Ran has discovered an old UNE mobile suit, the Gundam X, and now he uses it to help out the Vulture ship Freeden in its struggle to keep the powers that be from repeating the mistakes of the past.",

Anticipating an extraterrestrial invasion, Earth's feudal lords organize militias armed with cars and biplanes to do battle with the Moonrace's army of giant two-legged war machines.\r\n\r\nCaught in the middle of this war of the worlds is a youth named Loran Cehack, who finds a mysterious artifact - a relic of Earth's forgotten space age - entombed in stone.

Its focus was a group of young Express riders based at the waystation in Sweetwater, Kansas. Running the station was ex-Texas Ranger and all-around eccentric Teaspoon Hunter. The role of cook, housekeeper and mother hen was filled first by Emma and later by Rachel. The riders included the future \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody and James Butler (\"Wild Bill\") Hickok, as well as Ike, a mute, Buck, a half-White/half-Kiowa scout and the Kid, a quiet Southerner. Their final member was Lou, a young woman who lived and worked with the riders disguised as a boy. In second season, their group was joined by Noah Dixon.",

His supporting characters included Maurice the Gorilla, Stuie the Elephant, Eduardo the Jaguar, Norman the Poacher, and other characters. The original Marsupilami stories by Franquin never encountered a gorilla or elephant, since these species are native to Africa, while the marsupilami originates from South America.\r\n\r\nThere were thirteen episodes in the series, and the series lasted one season. Reruns of the show were aired on both Disney Channel (1995-1998) and Toon Disney (1998-2009).",

The new series did some updating to the original: strong independent teenage girl Jessie Bradshaw was introduced in the fourth episode and became a member of the Quest team. The producers also added Hardrock, a stone-like warrior from deep beneath the Earth, who helped out the Quests. They also split the original Quest plane into two ships - Questor 2 attached to Questor 1 but could detach for 1-man missions as necessary.",

The girls are less than enthusiastic about this idea, and only want to return home. Clef further explains that they must seek out the three Rune Gods to help them fight. He bestows armor and magical powers to each of them. They learn from Clef that High Priest Zagato has kidnapped the Pillar of Cephiro, Princess Emeraude. The Pillar of Cephiro has the sole responsibility of keeping Cephiro alive and in balance with her prayers. Without Princess Emeraude, Cephiro would fall into ruin. Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu must fight off Zagato's henchman and find the Rune Gods if they ever want to get back home. They soon learn that friendship and loyalty are the only things they can rely on in the crumbling Cephiro.",

The agents traveled in luxury aboard their own train, the Wanderer, equipped with everything from a stable car to a laboratory. James West had served as an intelligence and cavalry officer in the US Civil War; his \"cover\" during the series is that he is a railroad president. After retiring from the Service by 1880 he lives on a ranch in Mexico. Gordon's past is more obscure; when he retires in 1880 he goes on the road as the head of a Shakespeare traveling players troupe.",

Episodes are generally 60 minutes in length, but some longer episodes and multi-part series have also been produced. The show airs at different days and times on local PBS stations.\r\n\r\nThough The American Experience has used many films from independent film makers and has been assisted by various PBS stations throughout the country, it has always been spearheaded by WGBH in Boston.",

It was then moved from its traditional Sunday nights to Saturday afternoons. After an eleven-year hiatus, Bullseye was revived and a new series was recorded for the satellite channel Challenge, produced by Granada at Yorkshire Television in the Leeds Studios, and was hosted by Dave Spikey.\r\n\r\nCentred around darts, the show placed three pairs of contestants (each team with one person to answer questions and one darts player) against one another to win prizes ranging from a new car, a speedboat, a caravan, or a luxury holiday, to the consolation prizes of a set of darts, a tankard (silver goblet for lady contestants) and a 'Bendy Bully', a rubber model of the show's mascot.\r\n\r\nFrom Series 2 til the show's end, the show was co-hosted by professional darts commentator Tony Green.",

Doris became a single writer and news reporter and all but two members of the rest of the cast disappeared! ",

The second segment featured a story with the Wonder Twins. The third segment was considered the \"primary\" adventure of the week, featuring the entire Super Friends roster (including the Wonder Twins) in a longer adventure. The fourth and final segment featured a story with one of the primary lineup and a \"special guest star\". This segment typically featured a problem that was solved using the guest star's unique abilities.\r\nBetween segments there were short spots with members of the Super Friends giving basic safety lessons, providing first-aid advice, demonstrating magic tricks, creating crafts, and presenting a two-part riddle featuring the week's primary plot line. This was the first season to feature two villains appearing in the comic books, Black Manta and Gentleman Ghost. Black Manta's costume was not black, and he was only referred to as \"Manta\"; both he and Gentleman Ghost only appeared in one episode this season",

After a season's absence, the series briefly returned on Wednesdays at 7:30pm Eastern. The syndicated version aired mostly in late nights. The program, between September 1957 and June 1960, became one of the first programs to be telecast in \"compatible color\".\r\n\r\nKinescopes of the NBC version were later edited into 104 half-hour episodes and rerun on the short-lived '\"HA!'\" channel and Comedy Central in the early 1990s, with new introductions by Allen.",

Created by comedy writers Allan Sherman and Howard Merrill, it was a derivative of Goodson-Todman's own panel show What's My Line?. Instead of celebrity panelists trying to determine a contestant's occupation, the panel tries to determine a contestant's \"secret\": something that is unusual, amazing, embarrassing, or humorous about that person.\r\n\r\nThe original version of I've Got a Secret premiered on June 19, 1952[1] and ran until April 3, 1967. This version began broadcasting in black and white and switched to a color format in 1966, by which time virtually all commercial network programs were being shown in color.\r\n\r\nThe show was revived for the 1972-1973 season in once-a-week syndication and again from June 15 to July 6, 1976, for a Summer run. Another production ran on the Oxygen cable channel in a daily version, with original episodes airing from 2000 through 2003. GSN ran a revival from April 17 to June 9, 2006 with an all-gay panel. In October 2006, GSN opted not to renew the show for a second season, although reruns remained on its schedule for some time afterward.\r\n\r\n(Wikipedia)",

Their father had previously been a miner and when he was made redundant he invested his money into the business.\r\n\r\nSince their father died, the brothers, led by the eldest Clive, have taken on responsibility for the business and things have gone slightly pear-shaped.

Clive and his brothers are constantly struggling to keep their heads above water and provide for the rest of their family, while trying to get the debt paid off.\r\nMarion (Pam Ferris)\r\n\r\nThe mainstay in the Eustace family is undoubtedly their mother, Marion (Pam Ferris).

All Saints also achieved popularity overseas, particularly in Ireland and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe series is set in a fictional Sydney suburban hospital, All Saints General Western Hospital. Its stories originally focused on the lives of the nurses of Ward 17, which was also known as the \"garbage ward\" because it took the overflow of patients. In 2004, after a year of low ratings, producers drastically overhauled the series, shifting focus from Ward 17 to the Emergency Department. A new set was established, many old characters were dropped and many new ones introduced. With this change, the series also came to focus more upon the lives of the doctors, as well as the nurses as it had in the past.",

This leaves his widow Ivy (Thora Hird) and gormless nephew Billy (Christopher Beeny) to take over the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the accident-prone Ivy and Billy have numerous mishaps, and hardly a funeral goes by without something untoward occurring.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe setting for the show is the fictional Yorkshire town of Oldshaw during the 1930s. The writer Dick Sharples chose this period as this was the time when undertakers were switching from horse drawn hearses to mechanical ones.",

Edward Casaubon sets in motion a chain of events that will change the face of Middlemarch forever. The efforts of the dashing young physician, Tertius Lydgate, to modernize the medical practices at the new hospital causes quite a stir, both in the political power structure, headed by the evil Mr. Nicholas Bulstrode, and the heart of sweet Rosamund Vincey, the town beauty. Smaller plots interweave the action and lead to reconciliation, resignation, remuneration and resolution.",

John's quest for the truth leads him to Majestic-12, a secret government operation (above all offices and law) dealing with extra-terrestrials. At first the show seems to be just another show about Government spies and greyliens, but look closer and you will see much deeper. The plot thickens. The Greys, it seems, are only hosts for the real aliens, called the Hive. The Hive are much more dangerous than was previously imaginable with the Greys. This horrible truth is to be kept from the American people by Captain Bach, the leader of super-secret government organization called Majestic-12. The two main characters are on the run from the alien Hive and from the Government, and their travels lead them all over the country as they learn more and learn to fear more. Many historical figures are woven into the Dark Skies story, an important part of the turbulent ambience in which the characters exist. Many bear witness to the conspiracy involving \"Majestic 12.\"",

Instead of a Boston bar being the main setting, a small airport terminal on the island of Nantucket was used as the main backdrop.\r\n\r\nThe regular \"gang\" included brothers Joe and Brian Hackett, both pilots, who ran a one-plane local commuter service called Sandpiper Air. They had little else in common. Joe was button-down, organized and serious, and Brian, a hang loose, free spirit. Thier mutual best friend since childhood was Helen, a once chubby but now beautiful aspiring concert cellist who ran the lunch counter. These three lifelong friends were the \"three musketeers\".\r\n\r\nThe other regulars included, Faye, Sandpipers rather flighty but always perky, sixtyish ex-stewardess who ran the ticket counter; Lowell Mather, the eccentric airport mechanic and Roy, the loud mouth blow hard who ran rival airline Aeromass.",

         "overview": "Iron Chef is an innovative cooking competition from Japan. Originally produced by Fuji TV, Iron Chef combined the excitement of a one on one sports competition with gourmet cooking. \r\n\r\nThe title Iron Chefcomes from the original Japanese title, Ironmen of Cooking.\r\n\r\nThis innovative game show was always popular in its native Japan, but it found international success when the Food Network bought the series and began airing English dubbed episodes. It became a cult classic as viewers were treated to exotic ingredients and innovative cooking techniques. No expense was spared. Chefs seemed to have almost limitless supplies of the most exotic and expensive gourmet ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe competition is hosted by Chairman Kaga, an over-the-top master of ceremonies. He introduced a \"secret ingredient\" that the challenger and the chosen Iron Chef had to incorporate into every dish. Originally, the program was 30 minutes long, but it was soon expanded to an hour format. Each chef presented his/her dishes to a panel of 3-4 judges who rated the dishes to crown a winner. All of the competitions occurred in a specially designed \"kitchen stadium\". \r\n\r\nThe New York Times once described Iron Chef as \"kamikaze cooking\". Iron Chefs and their competitors became celebrities in their own right. Storylines developed between groups determined to defeat the Iron Chefs. \r\n\r\nThe show was so successful in English speaking countries that several spin-offs, specials, and updated versions were produced.",

         "overview": "\"Stark Raving Mad\" centered on eccentric horror author Ian Stark (Tony Shalhoub, Wings, Monk) whose first novel, Below Ground, turned him into an overnight sensation. A practical-joker by nature, Ian spent the bulk of his time harassing his uptight new editor, Henry McNeely (Neil Patrick Harris, Doogie Howser, How I Met Your Mother). Sharing Ian's loft apartment were Jake Donovan (Eddie McClintock, Crumbs, AUSA, Holding the Baby), his mindless assistant, and lovable but horny mutt Edgar. Living across the hall was Maddie Keller (Heather Paige Kent, That's Life, Jenny), who tended bar downstairs in the pub that the gang frequented. Henry's snobby girlfriend, Tess Faraday (Dorie Barton, The Adventures of A.R.K.) spent a lot of time hanging out with Henry's new friends, though she resented them for taking up so much of Henry's time. Also seen from time-to-time were Audrey Radford (Harriet Sansom Harris, 5 Mrs. Buchanans, Frasier, Desperate Housewives), Henry's snooty boss who discovered (and lusted after) Ian, and her closeted husband Caesar (Chris Sarandon, Fright Night, Child's Play).\r\n",

Condemned for some shockingly atrocious crime, Chaney's purpose in relating the series' stories was to convince viewers that the crimes presented in them were worse than his, thus freeing him from his purgatory. This was hard for audiences to judge, however, because Chaney's original crime was never specified.",

Each episode of Super Friends would feature a rerun from one of the previous six years and three new shorts. These new adventures featured appearances by the core group of five Super Friends and Zan, Jayna & Gleek. There were also guest appearances from members previously depicted in Challenge of the Super Friends and the Hanna-Barbera-created hero El Dorado, who was added to the show to provide cultural diversity. This would prove to be one of the longer-lived incarnations of the series (three years).",

A quick-witted but impoverished writer from Chicago, Norman struck up a friendship with Eileen and the two were soon dating. Dismayed that his mother had chosen someone so far beneath her, Matt set upon sabotaging their relationship, but soon finds he has met his match -- Norman reveals himself to be cut from the same cloth as Matthew, and foils plot after plot.\r\n\r\nMatt and Norman's cat and mouse game continued and escalated for thirteen episodes, fighting relentlessly while always shielding the aggressively gullible Eileen from one another's true nature.",

Leading them are an even deadlier force, known as the Tekkamen.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the Earth is the huge man-made orbital ring known as the Space Ring. Constructed well before the arrival of Radam, it was the first human structure attacked. As the aliens attacked, it was largely abandoned, left to serve as a battle ground for Blade and the Tekkamen.\r\n\r\nFighting against the invaders are the Space Knights led by Commander Heinrich Freeman. They consist of Noal, the pilot of the spaceship Blue Earth; Aki Kisaragi, the Navigator; Milly, Communications Operator; Rebin, computer wiz and mechanic; and Honda, Mechanic and Repairs. The Space Knights have been unsuccessful at repelling the Radam until the arrival of D-Boy, a mysterious young man who has the ability to transform into the powerful warrior known as Tekkaman Blade.",

Marie was not included in the series, as well as Tommy and Virl, who both could not hear.

Fox) is a hip, hard-charging former undercover agent who teams up with Jess Mastriani (Caterina Scorsone), a recent graduate of the FBI Quantico training center who gets mysterious visions of missing persons. Along with evidence expert Antonio Cortez (Mark Consuelos), they join a special unit out of Washington D.C. run by powerful Assistant Director John Pollock (Justin Louis) that takes on bizarre and perplexing missing person cases. In the first season, Brooke Haslett (Gloria Reuben), an experienced by-the-book see-it-to-believe-it FBI agent was paired with FBI Special Consultant Jess Mastriani, a recent college graduate who suddenly gets psychic dreams which give her clues to the location of missing people after getting struck by lightning. The pair also worked with saucy forensics & computer expert Sunny Estrada (Justina Machado) and their intelligent boss Alan Coyle (Dean McDermott). The show is based on Meg Cabot(also known as Jenny Carroll)'s young adult book series \"1-800-WHERE-R-YOU.\" The season 1 theme song is \"This Dream is Real\" sung by Gloria Reuben and the season theme song is \"Till I Find You\" performed by Kina.",

Arrogant and assured, Nathan is the star of the high school basketball team and hails from the wealthiest family in town. Quiet, brooding and driven, Lucas is a loner, the only child of a single working mom. He's always kept his distance from Nathan. But their lives collide when a twist of fate puts Lucas on Nathan's team. The rumor that's haunted the boys since childhood now becomes more than just whispers as the half-brothers compete not only for control of the court, but also for the heart of Nathan's girlfriend. So unfolds a deep and bitter conflict that's been years in the making; one that will play itself out in their homes, their hearts and at school as they struggle to come to terms with who they really are - and the fact that they may have more in common than they ever imagined.",

Many of the Olympian Gods and Goddesses only glimpsed during the film pay visit to the young hero-to-be and help or hinder him in his adventures. However, the series ignores a certain fact about the movie; Hades believed that Hercules was dead throughout his first 18 years of his life, but they have many interactions during this time.\r\n\r\n",

Now, she's interrogating witnesses whose lives and circumstances have since changed, making use of today's new science and finding fresh clues to solve cases that were previously unsolvable, all of which appeals to this smart, driven detective. \r\nShe's also prepared for the consequences: that her work will open up old wounds and may lead suspects to commit new crimes.",

CBS cancelled the show in its second season, but it was picked up by a Canadian producer and aired in syndication in a half-hour format. The show contains mostly ironic or special situations with a twist at the end, which show the human nature, coupled with science fiction, horror or fantasy. Some of the show's writers are well known: Harlan Ellison, Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Sidney Sheldon and J. Michael Straczynski. The opening and closing music was done by The Grateful Dead.",

In addition to being a sharp divorce attorney in her father's law firm, Kate Fox has a knack for matchmaking, which she considers a hobby until a socialite bride credits Kate for her romantic success in the press and word of her talent spreads. Soon, to the dismay of her father, Jerry ( Ryan O'Neal , Love Story ), and her reluctant legal partner Nick ( James Roday , First Years ), Kate is juggling the conflicting worlds of divorce and true love. With her best friend Victoria ( Lake Bell , War Stories ) at her side, Kate is determined to bring a little romance into the world, perhaps finding her own true love in the process. Rounding out the cast are David Conrad ( Men of Honor ) as Michael, a potential love interest for Kate, and Jodi Long ( All-American Girl ) as nosy office receptionist Claire. Miss Match is produced by 20th Television with Imagine Entertainment and Darren Star Productions. Brian Grazer ( 24 ) and David Nevins also serve as executive producers. The series was cancelled and unaired episodes were shelved. Macy Gray performed the Miss Match theme song, Love Is Gonna Get You . Alicia Silverstone was nominated at the 2004 Golden Globe Awards and at the Golden Satellite Award in the category of \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy\" for her role on the show.",

Robert shares custody of his son with his ex-wife Neesee (LisaRaye McCoy), with whom he shares a tenuously friendly relationship for the sake of their son. Robert also finds himself in a difficult situation, attempting to maintain the peace, however uneasy, between his ex-wife and his fianc\u00e9e. Friends of the couple included Dirk Black (Tony Rock), Robert's single best friend and producer, and Tia's best friend and fellow teacher Jonelle Abrahams (Terri J. Vaughn). In season three, Tia breaks off her engagement to Robert, leaving a newly single Robert faced with a situation wherein Neesee must move in with him and Bobby temporarily after her apartment building is destroyed by fire. In addition to Tia, two other supporting characters, Jonelle and Turtle (James Vincent), were written out of the series. In season four, Laivan Greene joined the cast as Courtney, Dirk's long-lost daughter.",

         "overview": "The animated Duck Dodgers television series ran for three seasons beginning in 2003 and was inspired by the 1953 Merrie Melodies cartoon \"Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century\"--essentially a spoof of science fiction book series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Flash Gordon. The series stars Daffy Duck as Duck Dodgers, a hapless duck frozen for three centuries, thawed in the 24 1/2th century, and then assigned by Chief Scientist Dr. Ignatius Q \"I.Q.\" Hi to defend Earth from the Martians, who are ruled by the Martian Queen and protected by Martian commander X-2 (played by Marvin Martian). Duck Dodgers is an egotistical featherbrain who's easily distractible, so it often falls to his sidekick Cadet, played by Porky Pig, to hold things together and guide the team toward successfully completing its missions. In the 13 episodes included in this first season, each of which generally comprises two stories, Duck Dodgers repeatedly battles his archenemy X-2, but his attraction to the Martian Queen often complicates his missions, as does his sporadic realization that he and X-2 really have quite a lot in common. Among Duck Dodgers's other foes are a pollen-belching plant that causes accelerated aging (unless you're of Martian heritage, in which case it causes age regression), a fat-sucking vampire, a look-alike prisoner, a hoard of Martian gophers, pirate Long John Silver the 23rd, Nasty Canasta, and even Ed McMahon. Other notable episodes include \"The Green Loontern,\" in which a mix-up at the local dry cleaners lands Duck Dodgers in the middle of a Green Lantern battle; \"Where's Baby Smarty Pants?,\" when Duck Dodgers is tasked with transporting a wise-beyond-his-years baby and ends up discovering a hidden talent for impersonations; and \"Hooray for Hollywood Planet,\" where there's much poking of fun at the process and artistic liberties involved in turning a \"true story\" into a successful Hollywood film. The Duck Dodgers series is a great blend of zany cartoon fun and space",

It's Happening ran on Mondays through Fridays from July 15, 1968 through October 25, 1968. When 1968 ended, Happening '68 became just Happening, which was canceled in October 1969.\r\n\r\nHappening '68 was co-hosted by Mark Lindsay and Paul Revere. Their band Paul Revere and the Raiders made frequent appearances. There were guest performers lip-synching their latest releases, band contests with celebrity judges and other bits to attract teenage audiences.",

Now sporting a line up of the behemoth MSZ-010 Double Zeta Gundam and the returning MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, RX-178 Gundam Mk-II and Gundam-like MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki, the group is nicknamed the Gundam Team. As such, this became the first of a number of Gundam series where a team of Gundam mobile suits fight alongside each other regularly. The climax takes place at Side 3 in the Battle of Axis.\r\n\r\nOut of the major Zeta Gundam characters, only recurring captain Bright Noa and Axis leader Haman Karn make more than cameo appearances in ZZ; Char Aznable's planned appearance was canceled when Tomino was given the go-ahead to do the Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack movie. Yoshiyuki Tomino's original plan for the show which involved Char's return was neither revealed though Glemy's sudden change in motivation seems to give a hint that he fills in for him at the end, nor does Tomino himself remember it and aside from the openings, Amuro Ray does not make an appearance in the series either. The alternate ending presented in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation retcons the UC Gundam Universe, possibly eliminating the events of ZZ Gundam.",

First-time parents, Greg and Kim Warner struggle on a daily basis to become perfect at the job. Kim is a neurotic, stay-at-home mother, and although her husband, Greg, is a success in his career, his more difficult job is keeping his wife calm as they raise their year-old son, Sam. While Kim is determined to be the perfect mother and perfect wife and to raise the perfect son, her sister, Christine Hughes, a very down-to-earth mother of two [four-year-old Dominic and one-year-old Logan], continually reminds her that life will never be perfect. Christine's husband, Jimmy, is employed as a security guard and unconcerned about living in Kim and Greg's guest house and feels compelled to share with his brother-in-law his philosophy about being a husband and a parent while still remaining a man.",

         "overview": "Canada: A People's History is a 17-episode, 32-hour documentary television series on the history of Canada. It first aired on CBC Television from October 2000 to November 2001. The production was an unusually large project for the national network, especially during budget cutbacks. The unexpected success of the series actually led to increased government funding for the CBC. It was also an unusual collaboration with the French arm of the network, which traditionally had autonomous production. The full run of the episodes was produced in English and French. The series title in French was Le Canada: Une histoire populaire. In 2004, OMNI.1 and OMNI.2 began airing multicultural versions, in Chinese, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Russian.\r\nThe producers intended to make this a dramatic history of the Canadian people; as much as possible, the story was told through the words of the people involved, from great leaders and explorers to everyday people of the land at the time. The documentary makes effective use of visuals, transitions, and dramatic music from or evocative of the eras being covered. In the first season, actors representing historical figures spoke their words, while later seasons used voiceovers over photographic images and film or, when available, original recordings of the subject.",

Chief. Supt.) Mike Walker alongside Kate Buffery as Detective Inspector Pat North. They investigate serious and hard-hitting crimes and the series is still as popular as it originally was. In the seventh installment in the series, D.I. North was replaced by Detective Chief Inspector Roison Connor, played by Victoria Smurfit. The series was originally made as annual one-offs up until series IX in 2005. \r\n\r\nThe tenth series was originally planned to be shown in the autumn of 2006, but in early 2006 ITV commissioned a further four series, claiming that it was the crime drama they'd been looking for. Series X was held over and in January 2007, all five instalments were broadcast over five consecutive weeks. Due to the larger load of producing four new instalments, this was the first time in her career that La Plante had to call in other writers. \r\n\r\nFor series XII and XIII (and continuing into future instalments), two different writers worked on storylines she had suggested. Lynda La Plante said she was very protective over the series and its characters, and found it difficult to slightly let go, though the major commission was quite an achievement. The series is currently Lynda La Plante's longest running series and both ITV and La Plante Productions continue to be enthusiastic to continue the series, as after fourteen feature-length two-part instalments it is still highly popular. \r\n\r\nA further commission of five two-parters was made in 2007, now cut to an hour per episode due to ITV's new plans for hour-long programming during weekdays.

Instead, Joly often made fun of himself rather than others, and many scenes made people stop and either laugh or simply wonder what was going on; the passers-by are never made aware of the fact that they are on television, presumably until they sign a release form allowing the use of the footage shot.",

Jon Cryer stars as the voice of Joel, Robert Risko designs the characters, and the (real) band Fountains of Wayne does the music and several original songs per show.",

A lonely meglomaniac with technology-assisted powers of transmutation, he yearns for darkness and has pledged to destroy Lavender Castle from his fortress spaceship, the Dark Station, the most awesome destructive power in the universe, crewed by unseen slaves working deep in the bowels. In order to prevent this, Captain Thrice has set out on a quest to find the elusive Lavender Castle before Dr Agon. A previous encounter with Lavender Castle gave life to Thrice's walking stick and left the Captain with a special knowledge of its power and abilities. Travelling in his cottage spaceship, the Paradox, Thrice assembles a crew of misfits to join him in his quest, combatting evil wherever they find it as they travel the universe searching for clues that will lead them to Lavender Castle. But Lavender Castle works in mysterious ways and lends its power to the Paradox crew to protect them when they most need help.",

However, as humans begin to dominate solar systems, the scale of the skirmishes between planets escalates.\r\n\r\nThe Intergalactic Planetary Federation (IPF) was established to maintain peace and stability, to promote economic prosperity and to head off the threat of large-scale war. An era of peace prevails, but as each solar system begins to prosper, so do economic markets, which become the new battlegrounds. The IPF then establishes a new organization called the Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs (GOTT) to oversee fair trade among the aggressively competing planetary states. Enter our two heroines, GOTT receptionists Eclair and Lumiere - but you soon find out that receptionist is just their cover, because they`re really secret agents of Encounter of Shadow-work (ES), working on important economic dispute resolutions assigned by their boss Eclipse.\r\n\r\nFlying a hi-speed space cruiser, together with Donnershlag, their guardian robot, \u00c9clair and Lumiere solve problems between planets and organizations. Although their exploits are always thrilling, traps lurk in unexpected places, waiting to ensnare the unwary.\r\n\r\nOur heroines have special abilities. \u00c9clair is a beautiful battle titan and Lumiere has sophisticated computer-like information processing abilities. Working as secret agents of the Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs (GOTT), the two work to resolve disputes planets and organizations, sometimes brilliantly and other times disasterously. With international spy-like action and meticulously planned SF setups, this is a true SF action story!

The program shows a vaudeville- or music hall-style song-and-dance variety show, as well as glimpses behind the scenes of such a show. Kermit the Frog stars as a showrunner who tries to keep control of the antics of the other Muppet characters (and his temper), as well as keep the guest stars happy. The show was known for outrageous physical slapstick, sometimes absurdist comedy, and humorous parodies. Each episode also featured a human guest star. As the show's popularity rose, many celebrities were eager to perform with the Muppets on television and in film.",

         "overview": "Popetown is a controversial animated sitcom, billed by its producers as \"Father Ted meets South Park\", following the doodles and scribblings of a student at school during a lesson. His drawings depict the life of Father Nicholas, who lives in a Vatican City parody referred to as \"Popetown\". He is charged with being the handler for the Pope (who is always referred to by his title, and never given any name) who is a complete nincompoop with the emotional and mental maturity of a four-year-old. Father Nicholas must keep the Pope out of trouble, and make sure the general public does not find out that the Holy Father is a drooling idiot. Other characters include a priest who is a sexual deviant, and a trio of corrupt cardinals who secretly run Popetown and attempt to get rich behind the Pope's back. These and other elements caused the show to be extremely controversial.\r\n\r\nThe original English-language version of the show features the voices of actor and Popetown writer Mackenzie Crook, Little Britain co-creator Matt Lucas, providing the voice for one of the cardinals, and actress Jerry Hall. Ruby Wax is the voice actor for The Pope.\r\n\r\nThe series was originally commissioned by BBC Three in the United Kingdom, but was dropped from scheduling without a screening in the wake of protests from Roman Catholics. The premiere screened on New Zealand's C4 television network on 8 June 2005. Despite never being shown on British television, it was eventually released on DVD in the UK by Revolver Entertainment on 5 September 2005, in Australia by Roadshow Entertainment and in Germany, where it was aired on television, by Polyband. It is also currently aired on several MTV channels, including MTV Latin America, MTV Latvia, MTV Estonia and others. The show was also banned in some countries (for example, Lithuania).\r\n",

It was based on the popular Superboy comics created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\r\n\r\nThe 34 segments appeared as part of three different programs during that time, packaged with similar shorts featuring The New Adventures of Superman other DC Comics superheroes.\r\n\r\nThese adventures marked the animation debut of Superboy, as well as his teenage alter ego Clark Kent, who acted as the bespectacled, mild-mannered disguise for the young hero. Krypto the super-powered dog would accompany his master on every dangerous mission. Other characters were featured, such as Lana Lang, the foster parents of the Boy of Steel; Pa and Ma Kent. The town of Smallville also made its animated debut.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the production's budget, the show featured a great amount of stock animation as well as limited movement from the characters.",

The show, although based around crime-fighting, super heros and'evil do-ers' it seemed more to remind you of watching an episode of secret squirrel with all of its gags and laughs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMillionaire art dealer Radley Crowne (B.F.) and his mechanical bud, Dynomutt, enjoy leisure time in their base of operations; Big City, until alerted by The Falcon Flash. They immediately dash for The Falcon's Lair (situated in Crowne's penthouse apartment), where they switch to their secret identities, The Blue Falcon and Dog Wonder recieve their news/crime report via TV screen from the secret GHQ of secret agent Focus One and then jump into The Falconcar and speed into the night to battle crime and to save the citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDynomutt controlled a system of miniaturized transistors which allowed him to extend his limbs or neck and use them to perform extraordinary feats; only problem was, none of them ever really worked properly! B.F. (as D.W. would lovingly refer to him), was more Dynomutt's victim than his master,since more then a few times, D.M.s gadjets . But nevertheless, Dynomutt and The Blue Falcon, who was equipped with his own arsenal of supergadgetry manage to get the situation well in hand. Sometimes Lt. Mumbly or even Dynomutt's co-stars, Scooby-Doo and Mystery Inc. would drop in to aid The high-tech Duo in cracking their toughest crimes. Dynomutt Dog Wonder has the historic significance of casting the first African-American public official in Saturday Morning cartoons, Mayor Gaunt (voiced by Larry McCormick).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16 30-minute episodes of Dynomutt Dog Wonder were seen in 1976-77 on ABC'S The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour; it later became The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show when it was extended to an extra half hour.

Mr. and Dr. Olliff-Cooper become Sir John Olliff-Cooper, Bt, and Lady Olliff-Cooper.\r\n\r\nInterest and conflict is provided by the 14 servants, portrayed by individuals from several walks of life. Chief among these was Hugh Edgar, an architect from Surrey, who was cast in the role of the butler.\r\n\r\nParticipants received instruction and a set of rules by which they were expected to abide for the duration of the experiment. Most of the \u2018upstairs\u2019 participants enjoy their time in the house, which is meant to represent the years 1905-1914. Those \u2018below stairs\u2019 have a different experience; for those in the lowest ranks, particularly the successive scullery maids, life appears to be intolerable.",

Inside, Mr Benn asks the fez-wearing shopkeeper if he can try on a suit of red armour; he then enters the changing room, puts on the outfit, and walks through another door... and suddenly finds himself transported back to medieval times.

In all, thirteen episodes of the animation were produced in 1980 (shown in two halves), by McKee's own King Rollo Films, and originally shown as part of the pre-school 'See-Saw' strand.\r\n\r\nThe central character of the stories was Rollo himself, a child-like King who was always in need of advice and assistance from his friends. Among these were The Magician (a father figure) Cook (the king's cook, a mother figure, who was arguably the real ruler of the kingdom); his neighbour, Queen Gwen; King Frank; and perhaps most importantly, Rollo's cat, Hamlet, who was generally portrayed as wiser than Rollo himself.\r\n\r\nThe animations used the same distinctive colourful cut-out paper look as McKee's other works, such as Mr Benn, and one memorable aspect was that the characters' legs would rotate outwards when walking until they were at right-angles at the sides of their body.",

This whole thing began in 1963, when Blake Edwards needed an opening sequence for his film, The Pink Panther, so he commissioned David H. DePatie and Warner Brothers cartoon director, Friz Freleng to make one for it. The opening sequence turned out to be more popular than the movie itself, so United Artist commissioned DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to make Pink Panther cartoons for theaters. In 1969, due to the success of the cartoon, NBC started airing The Pink Panther Show along with another DFE theatrical cartoon... The Inspector\r\nIt was based on the Inspector Clouseau character. The Inspector was a clumsy French detective who bumbles everything up. It ran in theaters from December 1965 thru February 1969. There were total of 34 theatrical shorts. All 34 cartoons reran in television as part of the Pink Panther show in 1969-1971",

Stunned at the physical resemblance, Murphy unwittingly allows enemy agents to kill Wainwright, after which he assumes his identity. Although Wainwright's wife, Eva, realises that Murphy is not her husband, she allows him to continue the impersonation, because it is financially convenient, and because she is moved by his treatment of her. Murphy and Eva eventually fall in love. Two movies were made by editing episodes together, \"The Spy with the Perfect Cover\" and \"Danger Has Two Faces\". ",

         "overview": "The Aunty Jack Show was a Logie-award winning Australian television comedy series that ran from 1972 to 1973. Produced by and broadcast on ABC-TV, the series attained an instant cult status that persists to the present day.\r\n\r\n'The Aunty Jack Show' burst onto Australian television screens in the nineteen seventies. There had never been anything like Aunty Jack. Grahame Bond's outrageous character, the bikie and self proclaimed \u201cQueen of Wollongong\u201d, was the antithesis of television presenting. A moustachioed hostess who threatened to jump out of viewer's television sets and rip their bloody arms off.\r\n\r\nAunty Jack and her cast of characters, Thin Arthur, Kid Eager and Flange Desire brought a new sense of humour to our screens \u2013 irreverent, bizarre, full of original music (a rarity for a comedy series) and uniquely Australian.",

         "overview": "Scotch and Wry was a Scottish comedy sketch show which was broadcast on BBC One Scotland and starred Rikki Fulton. After two series, in 1978 and 1979, the programme continued as a regular part of the channel's Hogmanay celebrations between 1980 and 1992. The show gave early exposure to actors like Gregor Fisher, Tony Roper, Gerard Kelly and Miriam Margolyes.\r\n\r\nThe focus of Scotch and Wry was on predominantly Scottish (and in particular Glaswegian) humour - the viewer had to be familiar with the Glasgow Patter in order to understand many of the jokes. As a result, much of the humour was constructed around distinctly Glaswegian themes; such as the city's suburbs, its football clubs, and even its famous sectarian divide was also played for laughs. In later episodes, less of an emphasis was placed on this, and the writers began to draw on major news events that had happened during the previous year as their basis.\r\n\r\nIn many sketches, characters poked fun at Sydney Devine. He even appeared in a sketch once, a parody of Phantom of the Opera.\r\n\r\nIn later years it became customary of Scotch and Wry to include a post-closing credits sketch which was usually a dig at The Hogmanay Show which followed immediately afterwards. This usually involved Rikki Fulton interrupting a party to throw the television out the window before The Hogmanay Show started.\r\n\r\nAfter the series ended, it was replaced by Jonathan Watson's football-themed sketch comedy show, Only an Excuse? in BBC Scotland's Hogmanay television lineup.\r\n",

Each captain would have two guests on his team for every episode and they would try to prove who knew more sci-fi facts through a variety of ways including trivia, guessing what props were used in which movies, etc. The show ran for ten weeks and was a great opportunity for Greg to show off his gameshow host skills.",

The premise is simple enough: Daisy (Jessica Stevenson) and Tim (Simon Pegg) are out of luck and love, so pretend to be a couple in order to rent a flat together. Downstairs neighbour and eccentric painter Brian suspects someone's fibbing, and almost blows their cover with their lecherous lush of a landlady, Marsha. Fortunately he soon falls for Daisy's health-freak friend Twist, while Daisy herself goes ga-ga for pet dog Colin. Tim remains happily platonic with lifemate Mike; a sweet-at-heart guns 'n' ammo obsessive. The series is chock-full of pop culture references. In fact, each episode is themed after at least one movie, with nods to The Shining and Close Encounters of the Third Kind proving especially hilarious. Hardly five minutes goes by without a Star Wars reference, and every second of screen time from Bill Bailey as owner of the comic shop where Tim works is comedic gold. The look of the series is its other outstanding element, with slam-zooms, dizzying montages, and inspired lighting effects (often paying homage to the Evil Dead movies). It's an affectionate fantasy on the life of the twenty-something that's uncomfortably close to the truth.",

Sarmoti, another white lion who is Kate's father - and Larry's father-in-law - clashes with Larry on every subject imaginable. Rounding out the group is Snack, a mischievous gopher and Larry's best friend. It should be noted that the name Sarmoti is actually the acronym S.A.R.M.O.T.I., which stands for Siegfried and Roy: Masters of the Impossible.",

         "overview": "Outlaws, debuting on September 29, 1960, was a unique Western in that the stories were told with a dark edge from the point of view of the criminal. The audience was given the rare opportunity to see how the outlaws thought, how and why they plotted their crime, and their perspective on being caught. The show was also more historically accurate than most Westerns of the time, featuring actual outlaws such as The Dalton Gang, Bill Doolin, and Sam Bass.  The first season of Outlaws starred Barton McLane as Chief United States Marshal Frank Caine, Don Collier as Deputy Marshal Will Foreman, and Jock Gaynor as Will's nephew, Deputy Marsall Heck Martin. Deputy Martin disappered after the 9th episode (with no explanation) and Will's new partner was Deputy Steve Corbie, played by Wynn Pearce. The second season of Outlaws brought many changes. The stories were now like other Westerns; told from the the point of view of the Marshal. The setting moved from Guthrie, Oklahoma to Stillwat",

         "overview": "This series takes a look inside the mind of comic author, prankster, and journalist Victor Lewis-Smith as he lies immobilized in a \"comic coma\" in a BBC hospital for distressed broadcasters.\r\nThroughout the course of the series, Lewis-Smith confronts the dark recesses of his own psyche as he embarks on a guided tour of his internal organs via his bloodstream, accompanied by a chatty cabbie who doubles as a narrative linking device. The hospital storyline is woven around a series of comedy sketches that emerge from Lewis-Smith's subconscious when his life-support system is fed into a television monitor, in effect transforming him into a \"human video playback machine.\"\r\nThe result is a bold, bizarre, and hilarious collection of skits embedded within a surreal, highly innovative situational comedy format.\r\nEach episode features one or more of Mr Lewis-Smith's signature phone pranks played on some unsuspecting member of the public.",

His opening line to wife Mona Washbourne summed up his character: \"This is the worst holiday we have ever had...we have both spent over \u00a318 each.\". With 'Dad's Army' about to end, it looked as though Arthur had a potential solo hit on his hands, but it was not to be. \r\n\r\nNone of the 'Playhouses' made it to series form, some such as 'Naught For Thy Comfort' and 'Variations On A Theme' seemed written purely as stand-alone affairs. 'Swap You One Of These For One Of Those' was a left-over from 'Casanova 73' ( hard to credit it now, but 'The Sun' complained before its broadcast that wife-swapping was not suitable for television! ). Another outstanding show 'I Tell You Its Burt Reynolds' featured Leonard Rossiter as a buffoon who becomes convinced he has spotted the macho movie star in a T.V. show. His madness escalates, and Rossiter turns in his best performance since Rigsby. \r\n\r\n'Big Deal At York City' was good fun too, with Warren Mitchell as a lucky soul who's had a good day at the races, only to be preyed upon by card sharks on a train. Neat twist at the end. \r\n\r\nThe seven shows were as good as any of their past work, had high production values, and were wonderfully cast. 'The News Of The World' invited readers to select the episode with the best series potential. What the result would have been we shall never know, because Alan Simpson retired suddenly, l",

         "overview": "The series focused on a fast blue snake named Blue Racer chasing a Japanese Beetle. The character Japanese Beetle first appeared in \"Tijuana Toads\" episode \"Hop and Chop\" while Blue Racer first appeared in \"A Snake in the Gracias\". The snake and the beetle finally got his own series a year later and it was similar to Road Runner and Coyote. The series was actually a theatrical cartoon made from 1972-74 by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, but it was reruned in syndication months after the series ended, but only few local networks picked it up, and it was like the series never aired on TV, but it continued to appear on TV until mid 1980s. Please persuade MGM (they own copyrights to the series) into releasing Blue Racer on VHS and DVD.",

In spite of keeping the castle's inhabitants safe, the gargoyles are not respected nor appreciated by them, except for the Captain of Guard who sees great value and honor in these creatures. After being betrayed by the only human they trusted, most of the gargoyles are killed while sleeping, and out of anger the Magus puts a spell on the surviving gargoyles so they also sleep during the night. In 1994 A.D., the billionaire David Xanatos purchases the castle, moving it to the top of his skyscraper in Manhattan. With the castle above the clouds, the spell is broken and now the Scottish gargoyles live again in a world strange to them. The Clan is still reluctant about trusting humans, but after meeting Elisa Maza they find a reason to befriend humans again.",
